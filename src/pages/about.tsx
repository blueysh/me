          I&apos;m a 16-year-old software developer and computer science student
          from the United States. I have exprience working in freelance
          development and am currently at Candor Studios, providing Discord Bot
          and Minecraft Plugin development. I&apos;m always interested in
          creating expeirences that are useful and valuable to the people that
          use them.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[16px]">
          I have been coding for just over 3 years, mainly working in Java.
          I&apos;ve also worked with frontend web development using Next.js and
          TypeScript for 6 months.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[16px]">
          Beyond life as a developer, I work at Chick-fil-A. I&apos;ve been
          working there for one and a half years and currently hold the position
          of Team Captain. It has led me to acquire much experience in
          leadership and hospitality. In my free time, I enjoy music and playing
          video games. I play the piano and volunteer at my local church playing
          keys.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[16px]">
          I am always open to new opportunities, and of course, there&apos;s
          always something else down the road, and a new skill to learn. I
          don&apos;t have it figured out, but I try my best.
